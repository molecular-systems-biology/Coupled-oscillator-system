# Coupled-oscillator-system
Code used to identify and simulate the coupled oscillator system

 : GAMS code which was used to identify the coupled oscillator system from experimental data (compromise frequencies and natural metabolic frequencies, phase shifts between indivdiual oscillators, all acquired at different conditions)
 : Matlab code which was used to simulate the identified coupled oscillator system dynamically, using the parameters identified in the GAMS optimization
